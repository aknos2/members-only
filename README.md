# members-only

Create a message board using node.js, express, ejs, postpgsql, and passport.
The project is for practicing using passport by creating a session to make the user stay logged in while navigating the website. The website has a membership upgrade system which lets only membership users see the name and date of users posting the messages. You can only send messages if you create an account. In addition, it also includes an option to make users turn into admin so they can delete messages from any users in the message board.
